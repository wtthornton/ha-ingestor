# Home Assistant Ingestor - Architecture Documentation Index

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive architectural documentation for the Home Assistant Ingestor system. This is an **API-first data hub and ingestion platform** for single-home automation systems, providing RESTful APIs, event-driven webhooks, and time-series data storage for Home Assistant and external integrations.

## Quick Reference

**Technology Stack**: Python 3.11, React 18.2, FastAPI, aiohttp, InfluxDB 2.7, SQLite 3.45+, Docker  
**Database**: Hybrid architecture (InfluxDB for time-series, SQLite for metadata - Epic 22)  
**Deployment**: Single-tenant Docker Compose with optimized Alpine images  
**Architecture Style**: Microservices with event-driven processing, API-first design, and external service integration

## 🏛️ **System Classification**

### **System Type**
- **Primary**: Data Ingestor + API Platform
- **Secondary**: Admin Monitoring Dashboard

### **Primary Users (API Consumers)**
1. **Home Assistant Automations**
   - Webhook triggers (game events, threshold alerts)
   - Fast status APIs (<50ms response for conditional logic)
   - Entity sensor integration
   - Event-driven scene triggers

2. **External Integration Systems**
   - Cloud analytics dashboards
   - Mobile applications (via REST APIs)
   - Voice assistants ("What's the score?")
   - Third-party home automation platforms

3. **Analytics & Reporting Platforms**
   - Historical data queries (season stats, trends)
   - Time-series analysis (energy patterns, weather correlations)
   - Custom reporting dashboards
   - Data export for machine learning

### **Secondary Users (Admin Interface)**
1. **Home Administrator**
   - System health monitoring (occasional viewing)
   - Configuration management (infrequent updates)
   - Service deployment and control
   - API usage tracking

**Usage Pattern**: Admin dashboard opened occasionally (not continuous viewing)

### **Deployment Scope**

**Single-Home, Self-Hosted Platform**
- Small homes: 50-200 HA entities, basic automation
- Medium homes: 200-500 HA entities, moderate integration
- Large homes: 500-1000 HA entities, advanced automation
- Extra-large homes: 1000+ HA entities, complex integrations

**Characteristics**:
- Single tenant per deployment
- No multi-user access control needed
- Self-hosted on local network
- Optional cloud API access via VPN/tunnel
- Not designed for public internet exposure

### **Key Design Principles**

1. **API-First Architecture**
   - Every data source exposed via REST APIs
   - Fast endpoints optimized for automation (<50ms SLA)
   - Historical query APIs for analytics
   - Webhook system for event-driven integrations
   - Admin dashboard is secondary interface (monitoring only)

2. **Event-Driven Over Polling**
   - Webhooks push events to consumers (don't make them poll)
   - Background event detection (sports scores, threshold alerts) ✅ Epic 12
   - HMAC-signed secure webhook delivery ✅ Epic 12
   - Reliable retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) ✅ Epic 12

3. **Single-Tenant Optimization**
   - No multi-user scaling concerns
   - Simplified security model (local network trust)
   - Direct database access (no query isolation needed)
   - Resource allocation for single home workload

4. **Data Persistence First**
   - InfluxDB as source of truth for all time-series data
   - Historical queries more important than real-time dashboard
   - API performance > dashboard UX
   - Long-term retention for analytics

5. **External Service Integration (NEW - October 2025)**
   - InfluxDB as central data hub
   - External services consume data from InfluxDB
   - Clean microservices pattern (no monolithic enrichment)
   - Weather, energy, and other data via dedicated services

### **What This System Is NOT**

- ❌ User-facing sports tracking app (it's a data hub for automations)
- ❌ Multi-tenant SaaS platform (single home per deployment)
- ❌ Public web application (admin tool on local network)
- ❌ High-frequency trading system (home automation scale)
- ❌ Mission-critical infrastructure (home comfort, not life-safety)

### Data Flow

```
Home Assistant → WebSocket Ingestion → Enrichment Pipeline → InfluxDB
                                           ↑
                                    Weather API + External Data Services

Dashboard → nginx → admin-api (system monitoring)
                 └→ data-api (feature queries) → InfluxDB
```

### Key Architectural Patterns
