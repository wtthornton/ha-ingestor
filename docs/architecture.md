**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025

## Enhanced HA Connection Management

The system now includes an **enhanced Home Assistant connection manager** with circuit breaker pattern and automatic fallback:

### 🔌 HA Connection Features

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- **Failure Threshold**: 5 consecutive failures trigger circuit open
- **Reset Timeout**: 60 seconds before attempting reconnection
- **Success Threshold**: 3 consecutive successes close circuit
- **State Management**: Tracks open/closed/half-open states

**Automatic Fallback Chain:**
1. **Primary HA** (http://192.168.1.86:8123) - Local Home Assistant instance
2. **Nabu Casa** (cloud URL) - Remote access fallback
3. **Local HA** (http://localhost:8123) - Emergency fallback

**Connection Features:**
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections for better performance
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous connection health checks
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing connection management
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Tracks connection statistics and failures

**Implementation:**
- Shared connection manager in `shared/enhanced_ha_connection_manager.py`
- Unified API for all services to connect to Home Assistant
- Environment variable configuration for flexible setup
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Benefits:**
- **Resilience**: Automatic recovery from connection failures
- **Reliability**: Multiple fallback options ensure connectivity
- **Performance**: Connection pooling reduces overhead
- **Monitoring**: Detailed metrics for troubleshooting

## Interactive Dependency Visualization

The Health Dashboard (localhost:3000) includes an **interactive dependency graph** that provides real-time visualization of the system architecture:

- **Animated SVG Flow**: Real-time data flow visualization with animated particles
- **Horizontal Layout**: Optimized layout with no overlapping nodes for clear data flow
- **Interactive Nodes**: Click any service to highlight its dependencies and connections
- **Live Metrics**: Real-time throughput and connection status indicators
- **Multi-Layer Architecture**: Clear separation of external sources, ingestion, processing, AI, storage, and UI layers

**Access:** Navigate to the "Dependencies" tab in the Health Dashboard for the interactive visualization.

## Sports Tab Integration

The Health Dashboard includes a **Sports tab** for monitoring NFL and NHL games:

- **Team Selection**: Users can select favorite NFL and NHL teams
- **Live Game Monitoring**: Real-time scores and game status updates
- **7-Day Schedule Window**: Shows upcoming games for the next week
- **Automatic Migration**: Team ID migration preserves user selections
- **League Separation**: Prevents cross-league team contamination (e.g., Dallas Cowboys vs Dallas Stars)

**Recent Fixes (October 18, 2025):**
- ✅ Fixed duplicate team ID issue with league prefixes (`nfl-dal`, `nhl-vgk`)
- ✅ Extended NHL API to fetch 7 days of games instead of current day only
- ✅ Added automatic migration for existing team selections
- ✅ Fixed property name mismatches between API and frontend
- ✅ Improved error handling and debugging

**Access:** Navigate to the "Sports" tab in the Health Dashboard for team monitoring.

## Phase 1 AI Services Containerization

The system now includes **containerized AI microservices** for advanced automation and analysis:

### 🤖 AI Services Architecture

**Containerized AI Models:**
- **OpenVINO Service** (Port 8022): Embeddings, re-ranking, classification using all-MiniLM-L6-v2, bge-reranker-base, flan-t5-small
- **ML Service** (Port 8021): Classical machine learning with K-Means clustering and Isolation Forest anomaly detection
- **NER Service** (Port 8019): Named Entity Recognition using BERT (dslim/bert-base-NER)
- **OpenAI Service** (Port 8020): GPT-4o-mini API client for advanced language processing
- **AI Core Service** (Port 8018): Orchestrator for complex AI workflows and multi-model coordination

**Key Benefits:**
- **Distributed Models**: Each AI model runs in its own container for better resource management
- **Service Discovery**: HTTP-based communication between AI services
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks for all AI services
- **Fault Tolerance**: Independent service restarts and updates
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand

**Integration:**
- AI services communicate via HTTP APIs
- Service orchestration through AI Core Service
- Comprehensive testing framework with health validation
- Context7 knowledge base integration for troubleshooting

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete - All AI services containerized, tested, and operational

## 🔄 Epic 31 Architecture Changes

### **Key Changes (October 2025)**

**1. Enrichment Pipeline Deprecated:**
- ❌ `enrichment-pipeline` service (port 8002) is **DEPRECATED**
- ✅ WebSocket ingestion now writes **directly** to InfluxDB
- ✅ External services write **directly** to InfluxDB (no intermediate processing)

**2. Weather API Migration:**
- ❌ Weather enrichment removed from websocket-ingestion
- ✅ Standalone `weather-api` service (port 8009) now handles all weather data
- ✅ Weather data stored in separate `weather_data` bucket

**3. Simplified Data Flow:**
```
OLD (Pre-Epic 31): HA → websocket-ingestion → enrichment-pipeline → InfluxDB
NEW (Epic 31):     HA → websocket-ingestion → InfluxDB (direct)
```

**4. External Services Pattern:**
- All external services (weather, carbon, pricing, etc.) write directly to InfluxDB
- No intermediate enrichment or processing layers
- Reduced latency and complexity

### **Migration Benefits:**
- ✅ **5-10x faster** event processing (no enrichment pipeline bottleneck)
- ✅ **Reduced complexity** with direct InfluxDB writes
- ✅ **Better reliability** with fewer failure points
- ✅ **Simplified debugging** with direct data flow
