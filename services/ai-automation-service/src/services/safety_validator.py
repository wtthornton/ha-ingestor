Safety Validator for Accept Stage Enhancement
Task 2.3: Safety Checks in Accept Stage

Validates automations before creation to prevent dangerous or conflicting actions.
Target: 95% coverage of safety checks.

Safety Checks:
- Conflicting automations: Check for existing automations with same trigger/action
- Dangerous actions: Validate destructive actions (lock doors, disable security)
- Energy consumption: Flag high-power actions (heaters, AC units)
- Time constraints: Validate time-based conditions don't conflict
- Entity availability: Final check that all entities exist and are accessible
