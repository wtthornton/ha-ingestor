MQTT Capability Listener for Zigbee2MQTT Bridge

Subscribes to Zigbee2MQTT bridge and automatically discovers device capabilities
for ALL Zigbee manufacturers (Inovelli, Aqara, IKEA, Xiaomi, Sonoff, and 100+ more).

CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:
This component is READ-ONLY for Zigbee2MQTT topics.
NEVER publish to zigbee2mqtt/* topics - can disrupt Zigbee network.

class MQTTCapabilityListener:
    """
    Listens to Zigbee2MQTT bridge for universal device capability discovery.
    
    Subscribes to 'zigbee2mqtt/bridge/devices' topic to receive complete
    device list with capability definitions. Works for ALL Zigbee manufacturers
    by parsing the standardized Zigbee2MQTT 'exposes' format.
    
    Key Features:
    - Universal manufacturer support (6,000+ device models)
    - Real-time discovery when devices are paired
    - Automatic capability parsing and storage
    - Graceful error handling
    
    Security:
    - READ-ONLY subscription (never publishes to bridge topics)
    - Safe to run alongside existing Zigbee2MQTT automations
    
    Example Usage:
        listener = MQTTCapabilityListener(mqtt_client, db_session, parser)
        await listener.start()
        # Automatically discovers capabilities when bridge publishes

        BEST PRACTICE (from Context7): Subscription is registered, but actual
