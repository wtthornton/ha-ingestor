## ⚠️ **Important: Docker Configuration**

**Before making ANY changes to Dockerfiles or nginx configs, read:**
- 📘 **[Docker Structure Guide](docs/DOCKER_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide to Docker structure (DO NOT BREAK THIS!)
- 🚀 **[Quick Reference](docs/QUICK_REFERENCE_DOCKER.md)** - Quick reference for common tasks

**Critical files that must not be broken:**
- `services/websocket-ingestion/Dockerfile` - Uses `python -m src.main`
- `services/admin-api/Dockerfile` - Requires `ENV PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/src`
- `services/health-dashboard/nginx.conf` - API proxy configuration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Home Assistant instance with long-lived access token
- OpenWeatherMap API key (optional, for weather data)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ha-ingestor
   ```

2. **Configure environment (Recommended - Interactive Setup):**
   
   **Linux/Mac:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-secure-env.sh
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\setup-secure-env.ps1
   ```
   
   This interactive script will:
   - ✅ Guide you through all required configuration
   - ✅ Generate secure passwords for production
   - ✅ Validate your inputs
   - ✅ Create properly formatted environment files
   - ✅ Set appropriate file permissions

   **Alternative - Manual Setup:**
   ```bash
   cp infrastructure/env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your values
   ```

3. **Start development environment:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-dev.sh
   ```

4. **Test services:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-services.sh
   ```

### 🔒 Security Note

This project follows security best practices:
- ✅ Sensitive files (env.production, .env) are in `.gitignore`
- ✅ No secrets are committed to the repository
- ✅ Secure setup scripts generate random passwords
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow supports secret management

**Important:** Never commit files containing actual API keys or passwords!

📖 See [Security Configuration Guide](docs/SECURITY_CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services not starting:**
   - Check environment variables in `.env`
   - Verify Docker is running
   - Check logs: `./scripts/view-logs.sh`

2. **Home Assistant connection issues:**
   - Verify `HOME_ASSISTANT_URL` and `HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN`
   - Check Home Assistant is accessible
   - Ensure token has proper permissions

3. **WebSocket connection issues:**
   - Check WebSocket service logs: `docker-compose logs websocket-ingestion`
   - Verify authentication timing (1-second delay added for stability)
   - Check subscription status in health endpoint
   - See [WebSocket Troubleshooting Guide](docs/WEBSOCKET_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

4. **Dashboard 502 errors:**
   - Check nginx proxy configuration in `services/health-dashboard/nginx.conf`
   - Verify admin-api service is running: `docker-compose ps admin-api`
   - Test API endpoints directly: `curl http://localhost:8003/api/v1/health`

5. **InfluxDB connection issues:**
   - Check InfluxDB credentials
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check InfluxDB logs

### Cleanup

Clean up all Docker resources:
```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```
