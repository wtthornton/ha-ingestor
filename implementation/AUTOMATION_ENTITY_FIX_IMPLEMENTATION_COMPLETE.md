# Automation Entity Fix Implementation - Complete

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Critical Fixes Implemented

## Summary

Successfully implemented critical fixes to prevent the AI automation service from generating fake entity IDs. All hardcoded entity IDs have been removed from prompts, validation now blocks automation creation when invalid entities are found, and a safety net has been added for post-generation entity replacement.

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Fix 2 (CRITICAL): Removed ALL Hardcoded Entity IDs from Prompts

**Files Modified:**
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/llm/yaml_generator.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Removed hardcoded entity IDs from examples:**
   - Replaced `light.office`, `light.kitchen`, `light.living_room` with dynamic examples using validated entities
   - Replaced `binary_sensor.front_door`, `binary_sensor.office_motion` with dynamic sensor examples
   - Replaced `wled.office` with dynamic WLED entity examples
   - Replaced all placeholder entity IDs with `{REPLACE_WITH_VALIDATED_ENTITY}` placeholders

2. **Made examples dynamic:**
   - Examples now use `{example_light}`, `{example_sensor}`, etc. from validated entities
   - If no validated entities exist, examples use generic placeholders like `{LIGHT_ENTITY}`
   - Added clear warnings that examples show STRUCTURE ONLY, not real entity IDs

3. **Removed placeholder suggestions:**
   - Removed `'light.office_light_placeholder'` suggestions
   - Removed `'binary_sensor.door_placeholder'` suggestions
   - Changed to fail with error if no validated entities found

**Impact:** The LLM will no longer see hardcoded fake entity IDs in examples, preventing it from learning to generate similar fake IDs.

### ✅ Fix 3: Strengthened LLM Prompt to Enforce Validated Entities

**Files Modified:**
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Added explicit prohibitions:**
   - "DO NOT create new entity IDs"
   - "DO NOT use entity IDs from examples below - those are just formatting examples"
   - "DO NOT invent entity IDs based on device names"

2. **Strengthened requirements section:**
   - Added **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL** section with clear instructions
   - Explicitly states to use ONLY validated entities from the list
   - Provides clear failure options if no matching entity found

3. **Added final reminder:**
   - Clear reminder before YAML generation starts
   - Emphasizes that examples are for structure only
   - Warns that creating fake entity IDs will cause failures

**Impact:** The LLM now has multiple explicit instructions throughout the prompt emphasizing it must use only validated entities.

### ✅ Fix 4: Blocked Automation Creation on Invalid Entities

**Files Modified:**
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Fixed validation exception handling:**
   - Changed from `logger.warning(...continuing anyway)` to `logger.error(...)` with early return
   - Validation failures now return proper error response instead of continuing

2. **Both test and approve endpoints:**
   - Test endpoint (lines ~3537-3551): Now fails if validation exception occurs
   - Approve endpoint (lines ~3633-3647): Now fails if validation exception occurs

3. **Proper error responses:**
   - Returns HTTP 200 with `status: "error"` 
   - Includes detailed error message listing invalid entities
   - Provides suggestions for similar valid entities when available

**Impact:** Automations with invalid entities will no longer be created. The system now properly blocks creation and returns helpful error messages.

### ✅ Fix 5: Added Post-Generation Entity Replacement Safety Net

**Files Modified:**
- `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Post-generation validation:**
   - Added validation step after YAML generation (lines ~1742-1806)
   - Validates all entity IDs in generated YAML against Home Assistant
   - Catches any invalid entities that somehow got past LLM prompt restrictions

2. **Automatic replacement:**
   - If invalid entity found, tries to find replacement from validated entities list
   - Matches by domain (e.g., `light.lr_back_left_ceiling` → finds any `light.*` from validated list)
   - Replaces invalid entities automatically if replacement found

3. **Fail if no replacement:**
   - If invalid entity found and no replacement available, raises ValueError
   - Provides helpful error message listing invalid entities and available alternatives

**Impact:** Even if the LLM somehow generates invalid entities, the system will attempt to fix them automatically or fail with a clear error message.

## Remaining Fixes (Lower Priority)

These fixes were identified but are lower priority:

- **Fix 1:** Improve entity resolution confidence scoring (to improve matching accuracy)
- **Fix 6:** Improve location-based entity matching for multi-entity queries (e.g., "all four ceiling lights")

These can be implemented later if entity resolution accuracy needs improvement.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with original failing query:**
   - Query: "sit at my desk in my office I want the w all four ceiling lights to Natural light"
   - Expected: Should now use real entity IDs or fail with helpful error message

2. **Test with no validated entities:**
   - Query that mentions devices not in Home Assistant
   - Expected: Should fail early with clear error message, not create automation

3. **Test with low-confidence matches:**
   - Query with ambiguous device names
   - Expected: Should accept matches with lower confidence or fail gracefully

## Files Modified

1. `services/ai-automation-service/src/api/ask_ai_router.py`
   - Removed ~20+ hardcoded entity IDs from prompts
   - Strengthened prompt with explicit prohibitions
   - Fixed validation blocking (2 locations)
   - Added post-generation validation and replacement

2. `services/ai-automation-service/src/llm/yaml_generator.py`
   - Removed ~10+ hardcoded entity IDs from examples
   - Updated to use generic placeholders
   - Added warnings about using validated entities only

## Next Steps

1. Deploy updated code to test environment
2. Test with real Home Assistant instance
3. Monitor logs for entity validation errors
4. If issues persist, implement Fix 1 (improve entity resolution) next
