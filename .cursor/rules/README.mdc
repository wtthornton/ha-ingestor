- **architect.mdc** - System architecture and design specialist
- **dev.mdc** - Full-stack development and implementation
- **pm.mdc** - Product management and PRD creation
- **qa.mdc** - Quality assurance and testing specialist
- **po.mdc** - Product ownership and story management
- **sm.mdc** - Scrum master and process management
- **ux-expert.mdc** - User experience design specialist
- **analyst.mdc** - Business analysis and research
- **bmad-orchestrator.mdc** - Workflow orchestration and coordination

### Project Rules
- **project-structure.mdc** - Project structure and file organization guidelines
- **code-quality.mdc** - Code quality standards and best practices
- **bmad-workflow.mdc** - BMAD workflow integration and process guidelines
- **development-environment.mdc** - Development environment setup and configuration
- **documentation-standards.mdc** - Documentation standards and formatting guidelines
- **security-best-practices.mdc** - Security best practices and guidelines
- **epic-31-architecture.mdc** - Current architecture patterns (Epic 31 - enrichment-pipeline deprecated)

## How to Use

### Activating BMAD Agents
Use `@agent-name` to activate specific BMAD agents:
```
@bmad-master    # Universal task executor
@architect      # System architecture and design
@dev           # Full-stack development
@pm            # Product management
@qa            # Quality assurance
@po            # Product ownership
@sm            # Scrum master
@ux-expert     # User experience design
@analyst       # Business analysis
```

### QA Agent Commands
- `*unit-tests` - Run the project's unified unit testing framework
- `*gate {story}` - Execute quality gate decision
- `*review {story}` - Comprehensive story review
- `*test-design {story}` - Create test scenarios
- `*trace {story}` - Map requirements to tests

### Context7 KB Integration Commands (BMad Master)
- `*context7-resolve {library}` - Resolve library name to Context7-compatible library ID
- `*context7-docs {library} {topic}` - Get focused documentation (KB-first, then Context7)
- `*context7-help` - Show Context7 usage examples and best practices
- `*context7-kb-status` - Show knowledge base statistics and hit rates
- `*context7-kb-search {query}` - Search local knowledge base
- `*context7-kb-cleanup` - Clean up old/unused cached documentation
- `*context7-kb-rebuild` - Rebuild knowledge base index
- `*context7-kb-analytics` - Show detailed KB usage analytics
- `*context7-kb-test` - Test KB integration and cache functionality

### File References
When referencing files in rules, use the format:
- `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` for relative paths
- Always reference from workspace root

## Rule Types

### Always Apply Rules
Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are automatically applied to every request:
- **project-structure.mdc** - Project structure guidance
- **epic-31-architecture.mdc** - Current architecture (Epic 31 - critical for accuracy)
- **README.mdc** - This overview

### File-Specific Rules
Rules with `globs` apply only to matching file types:
- **code-quality.mdc** - Applies to code files (*.py, *.js, *.ts, etc.)
- **development-environment.mdc** - Applies to config files
- **documentation-standards.mdc** - Applies to documentation files
- **security-best-practices.mdc** - Applies to code and config files

### Manual Rules
Rules with `description` can be manually invoked:
- **bmad-workflow.mdc** - BMAD workflow integration

## Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Agents**: Choose the right BMAD agent for your task
2. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to code quality and documentation standards
3. **Security First**: Always consider security implications
4. **Document Everything**: Keep documentation up-to-date
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Write tests for all new functionality
6. **Run Unit Tests**: Use `python scripts/simple-unit-tests.py` before committing changes
7. **Leverage Context7 KB**: Use Context7 KB cache for up-to-date library documentation with intelligent caching
8. **Know the Architecture**: Understand Epic 31 changes (enrichment-pipeline deprecated, direct InfluxDB writes)

## Getting Help

- Use `*help` command with any BMAD agent
- Refer to [.bmad-core/user-guide.md](mdc:.bmad-core/user-guide.md) for detailed BMAD methodology
- Check [.bmad-core/core-config.yaml](mdc:.bmad-core/core-config.yaml) for project configuration
